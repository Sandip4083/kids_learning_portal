  <!-- Story 1 -->
  <section class="story">
    <h2>1. The Lion and the Mouse</h2>
    <img src="lion_and_mouse.jpg" alt="Lion and Mouse">
    <p>Once upon a time, a lion was sleeping in the jungle. A little mouse ran up and down on him, which woke him up.
      The lion caught the mouse and was about to eat him.</p>
    <p>The mouse pleaded, "Please let me go! Someday, I will help you!" The lion laughed and let the mouse go.</p>
    <p>A few days later, the lion got trapped in a hunter's net. He roared for help. The mouse heard him and rushed to
      the spot. The mouse chewed the ropes of the net and set the lion free.</p>
    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Kindness is never wasted, and even the smallest creature can help in times of need.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Story 2 -->
  <section class="story">
    <h2>2. The Tortoise and the Hare</h2>
    <img src="tortoise_and_hare.jpg" alt="Tortoise and Hare">
    <p>A hare once made fun of a slow-moving tortoise. Tired of the hare’s taunts, the tortoise challenged him to a
      race. The hare, confident of his speed, quickly ran far ahead and decided to take a nap midway.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the tortoise kept moving slowly and steadily and eventually crossed the finish line while the hare
      was still sleeping.</p>
    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Slow and steady wins the race.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>3. The Fox and the Grapes</h2>
    <img src="fox_and_grapes.jpg" alt="Fox and Grapes">
    <p>A hungry fox saw a bunch of grapes hanging high on a vine. He jumped and tried to grab them but failed. After
      several attempts, he gave up and walked away, muttering, "Those grapes are probably sour anyway."</p>
    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> It’s easy to despise what you cannot have.</p>

    <p>A shepherd boy, bored while watching his flock, cried out "Wolf! Wolf!" just for fun. The villagers ran to
      help, only to find there was no wolf. He repeated this trick several times. One day, a wolf actually came, but
      when the boy cried out for help, the villagers ignored him, thinking it was another false alarm.</p>
    <p>The wolf attacked the flock, and the boy learned a hard lesson.</p>
    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Liars are not believed, even when they tell the truth.</p>

    <p>A dog found a meat and was carrying it in his mouth. As he crossed a bridge, he looked down into the water and
      saw his reflection. Thinking it was another dog with a bigger meat, he dropped his own meat and tried to snatch
      the larger one. Of course, he lost both meat.</p>

    <p>Once, in a forest, a young bird asked a wise old owl, "How did you become so wise?" The owl replied, "I listened
      more than I spoke, observed more than I acted, and learned from everyone and everything around me."</p>
    <p>The bird began practicing this and soon became wiser with time, helping others in need.</p>
    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Wisdom comes from observation, patience, and listening.</p>
